Subsequently, you will be shown another square box of the same or different size and asked to reproduce the line that you have seen in the frame before. Pressing the back button or leaving the test will cause all progress to be lost. You will receive more specific instructions shortly.",

The line on the left has a larger proportion than the original while the right one a smaller proportion.",
